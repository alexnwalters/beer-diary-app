# Beer Diary

A React app that allows users to save a diary of beer reviews.

Live Demo: [Beer Diary](https://beer-diary-app.now.sh/)

## Setup

Download and launch Express server found at [beer-dairy-api](https://github.com/alexnwalters/beer-diary-api).

## Using App

### Login / Signup

Users will need to sign up and/or login to access their diary and have the option to review beers returned by a search.

Sample Login

```
Username: Testuser
Password: Testuser1!
```

### Diary

The diary page will list the user's reviews.  They can update old reviews or even delete them from their diary.

### Search / Results

The search bar allows users to search for a beer using a third-party api at [BreweryDB](https://sandbox-api.brewerydb.com/v2/). 

The returned beers results allow the user to select a beer that they wish to review, they have the option of adding a beer if they can't find it from the search.

### Review Form

The review form will ask the user to select the aroma, taste, color, and then rate the drinkability as well as an overall rating of the beer between 1 - 5.  There is also an optional notes field.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
